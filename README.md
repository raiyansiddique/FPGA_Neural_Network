The goal of this project was to implement and understand various implementation of Neural Networks
in digital design using Field-Programmable Gate Arrays, FPGAs, in order to understand strategies
for optimization and hardware acceleration. Initially, the focus was on implementing a basic and
explicit neural network structure that was trainable, and then later moved into exploring strategies
for more advanced optimizations, specifically in the context of Tensor Processing Units. The explicit
neural network structure is complete and usable, however only the main components of the TPU was
implemented due to time constraints.
